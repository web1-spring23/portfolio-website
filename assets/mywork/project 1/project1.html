    <h2 class="project">Typographic Logotype</h2>
    <p>We were tasked to create a logo that reflects a company given to us by random. The objective of this project was to employ the logotype across media, and to understand and create a logotype that is communicated clearly for that company.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For this project I was given a skincare company. I created the name and the color scheme for the company. I utilized Illustrator to create the logos and elements design. I really enjoyed creating this piece and is what made my realize this is the path I want to take with my graphic design major.</p>
